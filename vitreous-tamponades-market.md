<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vitreous Tamponades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gaseous Tamponades</li><li>Liquid Tamponades</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vitreous tamponades market comprises two main types: gaseous and liquid tamponades. Gaseous tamponades, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and perfluoropropane (C3F8), create a bubble in the eye to support retinal reattachment during surgery, providing temporary intraocular pressure. Liquid tamponades, like perfluorocarbon liquids, offer a heavier, denser medium that aids in the surgical process by stabilizing the retina and facilitating the removal of fluids. Both types play critical roles in vitreoretinal procedures.</p></p>

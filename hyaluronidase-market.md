<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hyaluronidase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Animal-derived Hyaluronidase</li><li>Synthetic Hyaluronidase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hyaluronidase market is primarily divided into two types: animal-derived hyaluronidase and synthetic hyaluronidase. Animal-derived hyaluronidase is sourced from animal tissues, typically bovine or ovine origins, and is widely used in medical and cosmetic applications. In contrast, synthetic hyaluronidase is produced through biochemical processes, offering a more controlled and consistent product, often preferred for its reduced risk of animal-derived allergens. Both types are utilized for their ability to enhance the absorption of other drugs and improve cosmetic procedures.</p></p>
